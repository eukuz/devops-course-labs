## Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

### **Fine-tuned Triggers**
- Limiting the CI to run only when changes occur in specific folders or files, rather than on every single commit or push. This conserves resources.
    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        paths:
        - 'app_python/**'
    ```

### **Explicit Environment Setup**
- Specifying the environment (like the OS) and the exact version of the tools (like Python) ensures consistency across CI runs.
    ```yaml
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    ```

### **Dependency Caching**
- Caching dependencies speeds up CI runs, as they don't have to be fetched from the internet every time.
    ```yaml
    - name: Cache pip
      uses: actions/cache@v2
    ```

### **Linter Integration**
- Linters like `flake8` ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.
    ```yaml
    - name: Lint with flake8
    ```

### **Comprehensive Tests**
- Run unit tests to catch regressions and ensure that the software behaves as expected.
    ```yaml
    - name: Run Tests
    ```

### **Security Scans**
- Tools like Snyk can scan  dependencies for known vulnerabilities, ensuring that the software doesn't have known security issues.
    ```yaml
    - name: Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities
    ```

### **Visibility with Status Badges**
- A status badge in README provides a quick overview of the health of project.
    ```markdown
    ![Python CI Workflow](![Python CI Workflow](https://github.com/eukuz/devops-course-labs/actions/workflows/Python%20CI%20Workflow/badge.svg)
    ```

### **Fail-fast Strategy**
- If any step in the CI process fails, the entire job should stop immediately. This saves resources and provides faster feedback.

### **Matrix Builds**
- Running tests on multiple versions of a tool (e.g., Python) ensures compatibility across versions.
